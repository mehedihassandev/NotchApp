## 🎵 **NEW: System-Wide Music Detection!**

-   ✅ Spotify
-   ✅ Apple Music
-   ✅ YouTube (browser or app)
-   ✅ SoundCloud

Uses Apple's `MediaRemote.framework` - the same API that powers Control Center, Lock Screen, and AirPods auto-switching.

## 🎬 How It Works

### Collapsed State (Seamless Notch)

-   Black notch shape (150px wide) that blends with MacBook notch
-   Animated wave bars when music is playing (3 capsules with staggered animation)
-   Song title preview (truncated)
-   Subtle 1.02× scale on hover
-   Minimal screen space - just 32px tall

### Expanded State (On Hover)

The notch smoothly expands downward with spring animation, revealing:

-   **Notch connector** - Seamless bridge from screen bezel
-   **Glassmorphic card** - Ultra-thin material with gradient borders
-   **Album artwork** - 70×70 with rounded corners and shadow
-   **Song information** - Title and artist with gradient text
-   **Progress bar** - Capsule shape with gradient fill and glow
-   **Time indicators** - Monospaced, current/total duration
-   **Play/Pause button** - Circular button with smooth press animation

### Animation Details

-   **Expand**: 0.6s spring animation (damping 0.75)
-   **Hover**: 0.3s spring animation (damping 0.7)
-   **Button press**: 0.3s spring with 0.85× scale feedback
-   **Wave bars**: Continuous 0.6s ease-in-out with 0.2s stagger

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Xcode Project

You need to link the Info.plist and entitlements file in your Xcode project:

1. Open `NotchApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select the NotchApp target
3. Go to "Build Settings"
4. Search for "Info.plist File"
5. Set the path to: `NotchApp/Info.plist`
6. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
7. Under "Code Signing Entitlements", set: `NotchApp/NotchApp.entitlements`

### 2. Grant Permissions

When you first run the app, macOS will ask for permissions:

-   **AppleScript/Automation Access**: Required to read Music app information
-   Click "OK" to allow access to Music.app

You can manually grant permissions in:

-   System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
-   Enable NotchApp → Music

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open NotchApp.xcodeproj

# Or build from command line
xcodebuild -project NotchApp.xcodeproj -scheme NotchApp -configuration Debug
```

## Architecture

### Key Components

#### Models

-   **`MediaInfo.swift`**: Data model for media information (title, artist, artwork, playback state)

#### ViewModels

-   **`MediaPlayerManager.swift`**: Manages media playback monitoring and AppleScript integration
    -   Polls Music app every second
    -   Handles play/pause commands
    -   Publishes media updates

#### Views

-   **`NotchBarView.swift`**: Main notch UI with collapse/expand animation
-   **`MediaDisplayView.swift`**: Expanded view showing full media details
-   **`NotchWindowController.swift`**: Manages the floating, borderless window

#### App Structure

-   **`NotchAppApp.swift`**: App entry point with AppDelegate
-   Hides from Dock (runs as accessory app)
-   Creates floating window at screen top

## Technical Details

### Window Configuration

-   **Level**: `.statusBar` - Always on top
-   **Style**: Borderless, transparent background
-   **Position**: Top center, 10px from screen edge
-   **Size**: 400x200 (adaptive to content)

### Media Integration

-   Uses AppleScript to communicate with Music.app
-   Falls back to MPNowPlayingInfoCenter when available
-   Updates every 1 second for real-time progress

### Animations

-   Spring animation (response: 0.4, damping: 0.8)
-   Scale + opacity transition for expand/collapse
-   Animated "playing" bars in collapsed state

## Permissions Required

### Info.plist Keys

-   `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription`: Control Music app
-   `NSAppleMusicUsageDescription`: Access Apple Music
-   `LSUIElement`: Hide from Dock

### Entitlements

-   `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`: App Sandbox
-   `com.apple.security.scripting-targets`: Music.app access
-   `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events`: AppleScript access

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

-   📸 Drag-and-drop tray for images/photos
-   🎬 Video player integration
-   ⚙️ Customization settings (size, position, appearance)
-   🔔 Notifications for song changes
-   ⌨️ Global keyboard shortcuts
-   🎨 Theme customization

## Troubleshooting

### App doesn't show media info

1. Make sure Music.app is running and playing media
2. Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
3. Ensure NotchApp has permission to control Music.app

### Window not appearing

1. Check that the app is running (look in Activity Monitor)
2. Try quitting and restarting the app
3. Check Console.app for any error messages

### AppleScript errors

-   Grant permissions in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
-   You may need to restart the app after granting permissions

## Development

### Requirements

-   macOS 13.0 or later
-   Xcode 15.0 or later
-   Swift 5.9 or later
